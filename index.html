    Hey! My name is Allen Zhou.
    <br><br>
    I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at UT Austin.
    Recently, I've been spending a lot of my time developing
    a mobile application with React Native.
    <br><br>
    My hobbies? I play a lot of soccer, saxophone, and guitar. Also,
    I collect sunglasses. So far, I have one pair.
    <br><br>
    Some of the websites I've built from scratch.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://apalebluedot.world" target = "none">
          In the name of Carl Sagan
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://moroninc.com" target = "none">
          Moron: Idea Development Group
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href = "https://verdantleaf.org" target = "none">
          High school article publishing
        </a>
      </li>
